# High-Level Design Document

## System Architecture

The Hephaestus system is designed as a distributed service for monitoring and resolving system issues. Below is the high-level architecture diagram:

    A[Client] -->|Request| B[Load Balancer]
    B -->|Route| C[Server]
    C -->|Process| D[Repository Service]
    C -->|Stream| E[Log Processor]
    E -->|Analyze| F[Model Engine]
    D -->|Fetch| G[Remote Repository Integration]
    C -->|Monitor| H[Metrics Collector]

```

## Core Components

### 1. Repository Service
- Manages file operations
- Maintains virtual repository state
- Coordinates with remote repository service
- Handles change request creation

### 2. Log Processor
- Processes incoming log streams
- Filters and categorizes logs
- Maintains log context for analysis
- Routes logs to appropriate handlers

### 3. Node Manager
- Manages node lifecycle
- Tracks node health
- Handles node registration
- Coordinates node operations

### 4. Model Integration
- Processes log data
- Context preparation for model
- Solution generation
- Validation of proposals

### 5. Remote Repository Integration
- Version control system integration
- File operations
- Change request management
- Repository synchronization

## Data Flow

### 1. Log Processing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    participant L as Log Processor
    participant M as Model Engine
    C->>S: Send Logs
    S->>L: Process Logs
    L->>M: Analyze
    M->>S: Generate Solution
    S->>C: Return Response
```

### 2. Repository Operation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    participant R as Repository
    participant M as Model
    participant G as Remote Repository
    C->>S: Request
    S->>R: Process
    R->>M: Analyze
    M->>R: Generate Changes
    R->>G: Submit Changes
    G->>S: Change Request Details
    S->>C: Response
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- In-memory caching for frequent operations
- File content caching
- Reduced remote repository API calls
- Cache invalidation policies

### 2. Concurrency
- Parallel log processing

- Asynchronous model requests
- Connection pooling

### 3. Resource Management
- Connection limits
- Request timeouts
- Rate limiting
- Resource pooling

## Reliability

### 1. Fault Tolerance

- Graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms

### 2. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types
- Error propagation
- Recovery procedures
- Error reporting

### 3. Monitoring
- Health checks

## Security

### 1. Authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Remote repository authentication
- Model provider authentication
- Node authentication

### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access
- Operation permissions
- Resource access control
- Token validation

### 3. Data Protection
- Secure communication
- Token encryption

- Audit logging

## Observability

### 1. Logging
- Structured logging
- Log levels
- Context tracking
- Log aggregation

### 2. Metrics
